# GenAI Bootcamp 2025

## Week 1 Standup
Sat, Feb 8, 2025

**What you accomplished during the bootcamp week?**
- Built a conceptual GenAI architecture
- Wrote prompts for ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and Ollama llama3.2
- Compared the response of the three models above
- Decided on a LLM to use for my sentence constructor, Claude
- Did a technical analysis of my findings

**Any obstacles you faced and how you overcame them?**

The new terminology and technology was definitely an obstacle for me. RAG, understanding how a GenAI architecture works, learning Japanese are some examples. 

I am in a fortunate situation where I have taken machine learning courses in the past and can leverage that knowledge to understand what's going on right now. When I am confused, I go to the respective GenAI Essentials videos for a recap. I also found Rola's introductory machine learning course to be very useful. It was especially useful to understand how the theory applies in a practical setting.

Learning Japanese was looking like a steep learning curve for me. I decided to choose Urdu, the language my parents speak. While I can communicate in the language, I never formally learned it. I was born in Canada and English & French were the primary languages taught in school. I don't know too much urdu vocabulary, grammar, and I don't know how to read and write. I thought I would take this opportunity to learn my native language and connect with my family on a deeper level.

**Details about any challenges you attempted during the bootcamp week?**

1. I am still unsure about some machine learning terminology. I've been taking Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization course on the side to gain a better understanding.
2. Using free tier versions of LLM. I do want the full capability of the model, but I don't want to fall into the trap of using money to solve my problems. I've been exploring free versions before investing into models with money. This is a work in progress.

## Week 2 Standup
Fri, Feb 21, 2025

Getting to this standup quite late, I should technically be wrapping up with Week 3 right now. I wrote the backend and frontend technical requiremenets, and I started working on some of the backend code. It was really interesting to see Windsurf leverage the techincal requirements to do some of the backend work for me. I'm curious to see how it would do the same for the frontend. Unfortunately, I need to start moving along with Week 3 and then Week 4 starting tomorrow. So I'll probably just use the standard backend and frontend that Andrew created. I'll begin Week 3 and Week 4 work by Monday. I should be clear of my other commitments by then.

## Week 3 Standup
Sat, Feb 22, 2025

Not much of an update since yesterday. Will be rigourously catching up on Week 3 and Week 4 this coming week. Attended both lectures, watched most of the videos for Week 3. Didn't get the chance to implement the Language Learning App though from Week 3. We had Week 4 lecture today and saw some cool topics covered with James. We went over Kubernetes, Docker, the concepts of containers, and creating service classes. Can't wait to get started on this.

Note: I think the lectures are 0-index based. So Week 1 was referred to Week 0 and Week 4 is referred to Week 3. I'm just sticking with 1-indexed based xD

## Week 4 Standup
Tues, March 4, 2025

Lots and lots of catching up. Wrapped up week 2 over the weekend and submitted week 3 today. Not completed, but at least trying to submit consistently to show some of the work I've been doing. Now working on Week 4 and Week 5 before this coming Saturday.
