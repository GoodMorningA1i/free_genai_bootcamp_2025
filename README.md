### Week 1 Standup
Sat, Feb 8, 2025

**What you accomplished during the bootcamp week?**
- Built a conceptual GenAI architecture
- Wrote prompts for ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and Ollama llama3.2
- Compared the response of the three models above
- Decided on a LLM to use for my sentence constructor, Claude
- Did a technical analysis of my findings

**Any obstacles you faced and how you overcame them?**

The new terminology and technology was definitely an obstacle for me. RAG, understanding how a GenAI architecture works, learning Japanese are some examples. 

I am in a fortunate situation where I have taken machine learning courses in the past and can leverage that knowledge to understand what's going on right now. When I am confused, I go to the respective GenAI Essentials videos for a recap. I also found Rola's introductory machine learning course to be very useful. It was especially useful to understand how the theory applies in a practical setting.

Learning Japanese was looking like a steep learning curve for me. I decided to choose Urdu, the language my parents speak. While I can communicate in the language, I never formally learned it. I was born in Canada and English & French were the primary languages taught in school. I don't know too much urdu vocabulary, grammar, and I don't know how to read and write. I thought I would take this opportunity to learn my native language and connect with my family on a deeper level.

**Details about any challenges you attempted during the bootcamp week?**

1. I am still unsure about some machine learning terminology. I've been taking Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization course on the side to gain a better understanding.
2. Using free tier versions of LLM. I do want the full capability of the model, but I don't want to fall into the trap of using money to solve my problems. I've been exploring free versions before investing into models with money. This is a work in progress.

### Week 2 Standup
Fri, Feb 21, 2025

Getting to this standup quite late, I should technically be wrapping up with Week 3 right now. I wrote the backend and frontend technical requiremenets, and I started working on some of the backend code. It was really interesting to see Windsurf leverage the techincal requirements to do some of the backend work for me. I'm curious to see how it would do the same for the frontend. Unfortunately, I need to start moving along with Week 3 and then Week 4 starting tomorrow. So I'll probably just use the standard backend and frontend that Andrew created. I'll begin Week 3 and Week 4 work by Monday. I should be clear of my other commitments by then.

### Week 3 Standup
Sat, Feb 22, 2025

Not much of an update since yesterday. Will be rigourously catching up on Week 3 and Week 4 this coming week. Attended both lectures, watched most of the videos for Week 3. Didn't get the chance to implement the Language Learning App though from Week 3. We had Week 4 lecture today and saw some cool topics covered with James. We went over Kubernetes, Docker, the concepts of containers, and creating service classes. Can't wait to get started on this.

Note: I think the lectures are 0-index based. So Week 1 was referred to Week 0 and Week 4 is referred to Week 3. I'm just sticking with 1-indexed based xD

### Week 4 Standup
Tues, March 4, 2025

Lots and lots of catching up. Wrapped up week 2 over the weekend and submitted week 3 today. Not completed, but at least trying to submit consistently to show some of the work I've been doing. Now working on Week 4 and Week 5 before this coming Saturday.

### Week 5 Standup
Tues, March 11, 2025

Caught up on videos! Main focus this past week was OPEA and how to leverage this with Docker. With all of this knowledge and practical exercises, I do want to build a MVP (minimum viable product) of my own. I'm thinking of translating a GenAI feature into a mobile app. I currently work as an iOS Developer so I thought this would be a great learning experience to further enhance my mobile development skills while also learning more about generative AI. Let's see how far I get into it. 

### Week 6 Standup
Mon, March 17, 2025

Alright! Final journal. I've decided to wrap up my work on this project. I didn't work on the iOS app I talked about last week, it felt a big task for one week so I decided to leave that. These past 6 weeks were eye-opening to say the very least. Technologies that seemed like foreign languages before, now seem a lot more approachable. I thank ExamPro for giving me the opportunity to experiment and learn about GenAI. I feel a lot more confident tackling GenAI! 

On the contrary, this course was packed. There was a lot of learning. We spent one week on backend and frontend, which is really hard to master in such a short period of time. At the University of Toronto, there was an entire course (4 months) for web development and I was fortunate to have previous web dev experience to carry me through those steep learning curves. While this was overwheleming in some aspects, it was also pretty fun as long as you were consistent with the work. First of all, there were a lot of resources available. Hats off to Andrew Brown for all the video recordings he posted including hours of debugging code. Second of all, learning a little about everything is a great way to gain a big picture idea of how a system works. I've been learning one topic at a time and would go into the theory of neural networks. Getting my hands dirty and widening my perspective was a nice change. 

That's all I really have to say. I did mainly work from Andrew's videos. There isn't any projects in here that I truly coded from scratch. And I think that's okay! I learned a bunch, tried to consistently do something every week (even if 1-2 weeks were very minimal), and ready to move forward with my next project :)
