# GenAI Bootcamp 2025

## Week 1 Standup
Sat, Feb 8, 2025

**What you accomplished during the bootcamp week?**
- Built a conceptual GenAI architecture
- Wrote prompts for ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and Ollama llama3.2
- Compared the response of the three models above
- Decided on a LLM to use for my sentence constructor, Claude
- Did a technical analysis of my findings

**Any obstacles you faced and how you overcame them?**

The new terminology and technology was definitely an obstacle for me. RAG, understanding how a GenAI architecture works, learning Japanese are some examples. 

I am in a fortunate situation where I have taken machine learning courses in the past and can leverage that knowledge to understand what's going on right now. When I am confused, I go to the respective GenAI Essentials videos for a recap. I also found Rola's introductory machine learning course to be very useful. It was especially useful to understand how the theory applies in a practical setting.

Learning Japanese was looking like a steep learning curve for me. I decided to choose Urdu, the language my parents speak. While I can communicate in the language, I never formally learned it. I was born in Canada and English & French were the primary languages taught in school. I don't know too much vocabulary, grammar, and I don't know how to read and write. I thought I would take this opportunity to learn my native language and connect with my family on a deeper level.

**Details about any challenges you attempted during the bootcamp week?**

1. I am still unsure about some machine learning terminology. I've been taking Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization course on the side to gain a better understanding.
2. Using free tier versions of LLM. I do want the full capability of the model, but I don't want to fall into the trap of using money to solve my problems. I've been exploring free versions before investing into models with money. This is a work in progress.
